# End Session Checklist and Actions

This document outlines the recommended steps and actions to perform at the end of each development session to ensure progress is recorded, the repository is synchronized, and the environment is ready for the next session.

When ending a session, use a command like "read and do endsession" or similar to trigger the execution of these steps.

## 1. Summarize Session Progress

Briefly reflect on the key accomplishments, challenges, and learnings from the current session. This summary will be used to update the project progress document.

## 2. Update Project Progress Document

Trigger the AI assistant to update the main project progress document (`progress.md`) with the summary from Step 1, including a timestamp for the session's end.

* **AI Action:** Read current `progress.md`, add a timestamped summary of the session, and write the updated content back to `progress.md`.
* **User Action (if AI write fails):** Be prepared to manually update `progress.md` using an accessible Git tool (e.g., GitHub web editor) if the AI's write operation fails.

## 3. Review Outstanding Issues and Challenges

Review any tasks that were not completed or any specific areas that should be the focus of the next development session, as noted in `docs/Progress.md`.

## 4. Plan and Document Next Session Focus

Based on the review of outstanding issues and session progress, outline the key objectives and tasks for the upcoming development session. Explicitly document this plan in the "Planned Next Steps" section of `docs/Progress.md`.

* **AI Action:** Assist the user in formulating the plan and offer to write it to `docs/Progress.md`.
* **User Action:** Review and confirm the plan, and ensure it is documented in `docs/Progress.md`.

## 5. Ensure Repository Synchronization

Verify that all local changes made during the session are committed and pushed to the remote repository (`origin/main`).

* **AI Action:** Run `git status` to check for uncommitted changes. If changes exist, present the necessary `git add .` (or stage specific files) and `git commit -m "End session commit"` commands to the user with the 'run command' button.
* **User Action:** Use the 'run command' button to execute the provided `git add` and `git commit` commands.

## 6. Mandatory Final Commit and Push

As a crucial final step to ensure repository consistency across all environments and mitigate potential synchronization issues, perform a final commit and push of all pending changes.

* **AI Action:** Present the final `git push` command to the user with the 'run command' button.
* **User Action:** Use the 'run command' button to execute the provided `git push` command.

## 7. Generate Concatenated Session Context (for non-Git Environments)

If in a Git-enabled environment, generate a consolidated 'newsessionconcat.md' file that bundles all linked context documents. This file will be used for starting sessions in environments without direct Git access.

* **AI Action:**
    * Initiate a recursive process starting with `newsession.md`.
    * **Recursively traverse all Markdown files linked within `newsession.md` and any subsequent linked Markdown files.** For each discovered linked Markdown file, read its content.
    * Create `newsessionconcat.md` in the repository root.
    * Populate `newsessionconcat.md` by inserting the content of each traversed Markdown file. Each file's content should be clearly demarcated with a heading indicating the source file (e.g., `# Content from docs/user_config/UserPreferences.md`, `# Content from progress.md`). The order of insertion should broadly follow the order of discovery, or a logical order if a clear dependency exists (e.g., user preferences before project details).
    * Present the necessary `git add newsessionconcat.md`, `git commit -m "Auto-generated recursive concatenated session context"`, and `git push` commands to the user with the 'run command' button.
* **User Action:** Use the 'run command' button to execute the provided Git commands, ensuring `newsessionconcat.md` is updated and pushed.
