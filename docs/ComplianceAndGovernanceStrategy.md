# Thoughtless App: Compliance & Governance Strategy

This document outlines the high-level strategy and considerations for ensuring the Thoughtless App adheres to relevant legal, ethical, and operational standards, covering areas such as user data, content, and overall platform integrity.

## 1. User Data Privacy & Protection

### Current Thoughts:
*   **Data Collection:** What personal data will be collected from users (e.g., email for login, chat content for contributors)?
*   **Data Storage:** How will user data be securely stored (Firestore's capabilities, encryption at rest/in transit)?
*   **Data Usage:** How will collected data be used? (e.g., for service functionality, analytics, advertising targeting).
*   **User Consent:** How will explicit consent be obtained for data collection and usage, especially for features like public chat recording?
*   **Compliance Frameworks:** Considerations for regulations like GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) given the UK context and potential EU user base.
*   **Privacy Policy:** Requirement for a clear and accessible Privacy Policy document.
