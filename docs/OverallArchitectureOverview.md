# Thoughtless App: Overall Architecture Overview

This document provides a high-level overview of the technical architecture and key decisions made for the Thoughtless App, leveraging Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and Firebase services.

## Current Setup:

The Thoughtless App leverages a modern, serverless architecture on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and Firebase, designed for scalability, low maintenance, and cost-efficiency.

*   **Frontend (User Interface):**
    *   **Technology:** Planned as a React.js application.
    *   **Hosting:** Deployed on **Firebase Hosting**. This provides a global Content Delivery Network (CDN) for fast, secure content delivery, automatic SSL certificates, and custom domain support. It's ideal for serving static assets and single-page applications.

*   **Backend (API & Logic):**
    *   **Technology:** Python (Flask framework for REST API).
    *   **Hosting:** Deployed as a serverless container on **Cloud Run**. Cloud Run automatically scales based on demand, from zero instances to many, meaning you only pay for the compute time consumed by requests. This provides high scalability and cost-efficiency.
