# Start Session Protocol for Non-Git-Aware AI Instances (Consolidated Context)

**Purpose:** This document provides a complete, consolidated context for starting a new AI session on instances without direct programmatic Git access. It is generated by a Git-aware AI instance to ensure it reflects the latest project state.

*(The content below is a conceptual representation. In practice, this file would be populated by the Git-aware AI, concatenating the live content of the following documents in order:)*

### --- Start of Generic Session Protocol (from `generic_session_protocol.md`) ---

# Session Context Initialization Protocol (SCIP)

**Purpose:** This document serves as a foundational context primer for any Gemini (or compatible AI) instance at the commencement of a new session. It defines the stable operational protocols and the overall strategy for context management, designed to be timeless and independent of specific projects or users.

### --- Start of User Preferences (from `user_preferences.md`) ---

# User Interaction Preferences and Environmental Constraints

**Purpose:** This document defines the user's preferred interaction modalities and acknowledges specific environmental or tooling constraints that apply across all AI sessions.
