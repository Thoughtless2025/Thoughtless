# Thoughtless App Project Progress Summary

## Project Context

This project is the "Thoughtless App", intended to be a platform for sharing and discovering AI-generated chat conversations. The planned architecture utilizes Firebase services, including Cloud Run for the backend, Firebase Hosting for the frontend, and Cloud Build for CI/CD triggered by GitHub pushes.

## Completed Actions

*   Project files have been listed and reviewed.
*   The Firebase project ID, `thoughtless-7aacc`, has been identified.
*   The service account for CI/CD, `thoughtless-ci-cd@thoughtless-7aacc.iam.gserviceaccount.com`, has been identified.
*   The IAM roles for the CI/CD service account have been verified and appear sufficient (`Firebase Admin`, `Firebase Hosting Admin`, `Cloud Run Admin`, `Cloud Datastore User`, `Storage Admin`, `Service Account User`).
*   Untracked files (`.idx/`, `.vscode/`, `public/`) have been identified and added to `.gitignore`.
*   The `.gitignore` file has been committed and pushed to the GitHub repository.
*   `cloudbuild.backend.yaml` and `cloudbuild.frontend.yaml` have been renamed to `backend.cloudbuild.yaml` and `frontend.cloudbuild.yaml` respectively, and this change has been committed and pushed to GitHub.
*   Logging configuration (`options.default_logs_bucket_behavior: REGIONAL_USER_OWNED_BUCKET`) has been added to both `backend.cloudbuild.yaml` and `frontend.cloudbuild.yaml` to address previous Cloud Build errors. This change has been committed and pushed to GitHub.
