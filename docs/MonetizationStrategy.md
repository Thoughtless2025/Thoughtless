# Thoughtless App: Monetization Strategy

This document outlines the current high-level ideas for how the Thoughtless App might generate revenue, balancing financial sustainability with user experience and project philosophy.

## Current Thoughts:

*   **Advertising (Highly Non-Intrusive):**
    *   **Imperative:** Adverts must be entirely non-intrusive.
    *   **User Experience:** Only visual impact; no pop-ups, no sound generation.
    *   **Placement:** Discreetly positioned at the edges, tops, or bottoms of the screen (intended to be "out of sight, out of mind").
    *   **Rationale:** Prioritize user comfort and overall experience, even if this approach may run counter to typical advertising industry goals.

*   **Contributor Subscription (Monthly Charge):**
    *   **Model:** A monthly subscription specifically for "contributors."
    *   **Definition of Contributor:** Users who actively wish to have their personal chat conversations recorded and made publicly available for others to view and learn from. This offers a clear, value-added premium service.
